  <h1>My Process</h1>
  <img src="" />

  <div class="howto">
    <p>
      I am going to show you how I use my Ipad to create some digital
      illustrations like these...
    </p>
    <p>
      On this page, I'm going to share my process on how I create original
      pieces like this using procreate. These techniques are useful not just for
      the ipad, but they can be applied to any art software. Here are some of
      the specifications of what I will be working on:
      <li>IPad with Procreate installed</li>
      <li>Include Brushes</li>
      <li>
        4000x2000 Canvas set to RGB (any size canvas is fine depending on your
        preference. In fact, for the sketching phase, I used an 18x24 inch
        canvas, then switched)
      </li>
      <li>Imagination!!!!</li>
    </p>
    <h3>Step One: Skecting</h3>
    <img src="" alt="" />
    <p>
      The first step in my process is always the idea. This is the most
      challenging, but most fun portion of this process because this is where I
      can come up with ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this piece, I wanted to create a simple scene of whales coming
      together. Using different brushes, I planned out where I wanted each whale
      to be and how I wanted to see them based on perspective and composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      This phase is the foundation to the rest of your painting. Without a good
      direction on where you want to take your art, it will be very difficult to
      define what else you want to see. So remember to take your time just
      create. Once your're satisfied with the placement, its time to move to
      step two.
    </p>
    <h3>Step Two: Refined Drawing</h3>
    <img src="" alt="" />
    <p>
      Now it is time to get into work. Now that you have your sketch, its time
      to tie it down with a more finished drawing. Using another layer, start
      drawing over your sketch until you've added the details you seem
      desireable.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was tying down this painting, I consistently looked at the anatomy
      of my subjects and making sure any details I should add are added. This is
      especially important when your subject is a real, living thing. So if
      that's the case, reference is really helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
      On another note, making sure you take the time to include details is
      important. For the sake of time, I decided to leave it as it was.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Step Three: Basic Color</h3>
    <img src="" alt="" />
    <p>
      Now it's time to start adding color! What I like to do when I create my
      paintings, I focus on what I call "basic color". Basic color is the color
      you would make an object that doesn't have any light or shadow added to
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One great thing about using procreate is how veratile and robust the color
      tools are. You can choose your own colors or even pick colors from
      photographs by holding down with one finger. this creates an eyedropper
      function that can be used for color accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since my subjects are only two colors, I usually like to add some minor
      color variations to make them more alive. This helps to make your
      paintings less boring. I also included a basic background on a separate
      layer to establish my "atmosphere" (more on that later...)
    </p>
    <h3>Step Four: Lighting and Shadow</h3>
    <img src="" alt="" />
    <p>
      When using procreate, there are two layer modes I use when to make light
      and shadow. Those are Multiply and Overlay. Multiply takes the color
      you're using and "multiplies" it to create a dark effect. Overlay does the
      exact same thing, but instead, it settles on top-making it lighter
      instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using two separate layers for these effects, I usually try to focus on a
      specific direction. However, since our scene takes place in water, I'm
      going ot have to thinga about my light and shadow differently. That's were
      atmosphere starts to play a roll.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we look at a landscape, there is a reason that you can't see past a
      certain distance. The atmosphere is not invisible. It is an object we are
      looking through. No different from a window. When you look further and
      further ahead, you can see more layers of the atmosphere, hence why things
      become faded over long distances.
    </p>
    <p>
      And since we are painting in an aquatic scene, the effect is multiplied by
      10.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking this into account, I try to paint according to how light is
      reflected and refracted by all the subjects of my scene compared to my
      setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd like to say that art is as much technical thinking as it is creative
      thinking.
    </p>
    <h3>Step Five: Adding Details</h3>
    <img src="" alt="" />
    <p>
      Finally, we can add some details. At this stage, its now time to render
      out the painting until i'm satisfied with how it looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this final stage, I try to focus on different aspects of the art like
      abient lighting, refractions, details on the whales, particle effects, and
      so much more. I won't go into too much depth over this process because
      this stage is all stylistic.
    </p>
    <p>
      This stage is also good to touch up any remaining details you mightv'e
      missed. Here you can be as thorough or as basic as you'd like. This is the
      stage where I make things pretty.
    </p>

    <p>
      There you have it. That's a basic introduction to how I create my art
      pieces. Now that you have the knowledge, try for yourself and see what you
      come up with. But remember, an artist is only as good as the will to
      create, not the tools he has. I just gave you some techniques so you can
      make your own art, so you can use them however way you'd like!
    </p>
    <p>
      Have fun creating! and as one of my favorite illustrator/animator Aaron
      Blaise says...
